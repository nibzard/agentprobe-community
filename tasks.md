# AgentProbe Community - Task Plan

## Project Overview

AgentProbe Community is a backend service for collecting and sharing CLI test results from the AgentProbe tool. The project aims to create a community-driven database of CLI agent-friendliness metrics.

### Current State Analysis (Updated: 2025-08-03)

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** The codebase contains two conflicting backend implementations that need to be resolved.

**Primary Implementation - TypeScript/Hono/Cloudflare Workers (/src/index.ts):**
- ✅ Complete Hono framework setup with TypeScript
- ✅ Drizzle ORM with D1 SQLite database schema implemented
- ✅ Database migration files created (0001_initial_schema.sql)
- ✅ All core API endpoints implemented:
  - ✅ POST /api/v1/results (result submission)
  - ✅ POST /api/v1/results/batch (batch submission)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/results (query results with filtering)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/stats/tool/:tool (tool statistics)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/stats/scenario/:tool/:scenario (scenario stats)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/leaderboard (tool leaderboard)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/stats/aggregate (time-based aggregates)
  - ✅ POST /api/v1/compare/tools (tool comparison)
  - ✅ GET /api/v1/scenarios/difficulty (difficulty ranking)
  - ✅ POST /api/v1/export (data export CSV/JSON)
  - ✅ GET /health (health check endpoint)
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- ✅ Zod validation schemas for all endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration implemented
- ✅ Error handling with structured responses
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers configuration (wrangler.toml)
- ✅ Package.json with all necessary scripts for D1 operations

**Secondary Implementation - JavaScript/Express/MongoDB (src/server.js + routes):**
- ❌ Conflicting Express.js implementation using MongoDB
- ❌ JWT authentication system (incompatible with Cloudflare Workers)
- ❌ Rate limiting and middleware for traditional server deployment
- ❌ API key authentication with MongoDB models
- ❌ Routes defined but not aligned with TypeScript implementation

**AgentProbe CLI Tool (Python):**
- ✅ Core testing functionality implemented
- ✅ Result submission client (`submission.py`) with data sanitization
- ✅ Config management for sharing preferences
- ❌ Community commands (`community stats`, `community show`) not implemented
- ❌ `--share` flag integration not complete

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### Architecture Conflict Resolution (URGENT)
1. **Remove conflicting Express.js implementation** - Delete all JavaScript files that implement alternative server architecture:
   - `/src/server.js`
   - `/src/middleware/*.js` 
   - `/src/models/*.js`
   - `/src/routes/*.js`
   - `/src/utils/logger.js`
2. **Standardize on TypeScript/Hono/Cloudflare Workers** as the primary architecture
3. **Implement Cloudflare Workers compatible authentication** - The current JWT/MongoDB auth won't work with Cloudflare Workers
4. **Set up actual D1 database instances** - Replace placeholder IDs in wrangler.toml

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1-2) - REVISED STATUS
**ACTUAL STATUS: 85% COMPLETE** - Primary TypeScript implementation is largely finished

**COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Database schema and migrations
- ✅ All core API endpoints (11 endpoints implemented)
- ✅ Request validation and error handling
- ✅ TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers configuration structure

**REMAINING:**
1. **Resolve architecture conflicts** (remove Express.js implementation)
2. **Create actual D1 databases** and update wrangler.toml with real IDs
3. **Deploy backend to Cloudflare Workers** (ready for deployment once D1 is configured)
4. **Implement Cloudflare Workers compatible authentication/rate limiting**
5. **Test API endpoints** with actual deployment

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Week 3-4) - REVISED STATUS
**ACTUAL STATUS: 60% COMPLETE** - Advanced API features are already implemented

**COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Batch submission support (already implemented)
- ✅ Advanced statistics endpoints (aggregates, comparison, difficulty ranking, export)

**REMAINING:**
1. Build basic frontend dashboard
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Write initial documentation
4. Integrate Python client with deployed API
5. Add basic CLI commands for sharing

### Phase 3: Production Ready (Week 5-6)
1. Add monitoring and alerting
2. Implement CI/CD pipeline
3. Create advanced dashboard features
4. Add security hardening
5. Complete documentation
6. Launch beta testing

### Phase 4: Community Launch (Week 7-8)
1. Address beta feedback
2. Add final polish to UI
3. Create marketing materials
4. Set up community support channels
5. Official launch

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 100+ unique users submitting results within first month
- **Data Quality**: <5% invalid submissions
- **Performance**: <200ms API response time (p95)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Community**: 50+ GitHub stars, 10+ contributors

## Technical Decisions

1. **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers + Hono + D1 (SQLite) for serverless scalability
2. **Frontend**: Next.js for SEO and performance
3. **Authentication**: API keys with rate limiting
4. **Data Retention**: 90 days for detailed data, aggregates forever
5. **Privacy**: Client-side sanitization + server validation

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement OAuth for GitHub integration?
2. What data retention policy balances privacy and utility?
3. Should we add webhooks for real-time notifications?
4. How to handle versioning for breaking API changes?
5. Should we create a public dataset for research?

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize tasks with the team
2. Set up project management board (GitHub Projects)
3. Assign tasks to team members
4. Create development timeline
5. Start with Phase 1 implementation

## Resources Needed

- Cloudflare Workers account (Free tier sufficient initially)
- Domain name for API and dashboard
- GitHub organization for the project
- Documentation hosting (GitHub Pages?)
- Community communication channel (Discord/Slack?)

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap to make AgentProbe Community fully functional. The implementation should follow the phased approach to ensure steady progress while maintaining quality.
